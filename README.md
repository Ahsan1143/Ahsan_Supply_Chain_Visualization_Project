Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard
Overview
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive view of supply chain performance across regions and product categories. The dashboard is designed to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time delivery rate, average delivery time, cost per unit shipped, and delivery performance. It enables stakeholders to identify inefficiencies, optimize logistics, and improve decision-making.

Dashboard Features
