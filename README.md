Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard
Overview
This project involved designing a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and optimize supply chain efficiency. The goal was to provide actionable insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time delivery rates, average delivery times, shipping costs, and inventory turnover. By analyzing supply chain data, the dashboard empowers decision-makers to identify bottlenecks, improve logistics, and optimize costs.

Process and Steps Taken
Dataset Preparation:

Generated a realistic dataset with expanded regions and product categories to simulate real-world supply chain operations.
Included critical fields such as shipment and delivery dates, delivery status, inventory levels, shipping costs, and order volumes.
Ensured varied delivery times across regions to reflect geographic and logistical differences.
Data Import and Cleaning:

Loaded the dataset into Power BI and verified data integrity.
Created calculated columns for delivery time and on-time status to enhance analysis.
DAX Measures for KPIs:

Developed advanced DAX measures to calculate key metrics:
On-Time Delivery Rate: Percentage of shipments delivered on time.
Average Delivery Time by Region: Average days taken to deliver shipments in each region.
Cost Per Unit Shipped: Shipping cost per unit to measure efficiency.
Delayed Shipments Percentage by Product: Percentage of delayed shipments for each product category.
Inventory Turnover Rate: Frequency of inventory replenishment.
Revenue Contribution by Region: Share of total revenue from each region.
Delivery Performance Index: Combined metric for delivery efficiency.
Dashboard Design:

Created visualizations to present insights effectively:
KPI Cards: For quick access to on-time delivery rate, average delivery time, and other key metrics.
Bar and Column Charts: To compare delivery performance and cost efficiency by region and product.
Line Charts: To track cumulative orders over time and identify trends.
Pie and Tree Maps: For revenue distribution and inventory levels.
Conditional Formatting: Applied color-coded visuals (green, yellow, red) to highlight performance thresholds.
Insights Gained
On-Time Delivery Analysis:

Identified regions with low on-time delivery rates, such as Africa and South America, highlighting logistical challenges.
Product-Specific Performance:

Certain product categories, such as Automotive and Furniture, had higher delayed shipment percentages, indicating potential supply chain inefficiencies.
Cost and Revenue Optimization:

High shipping costs per unit in specific regions (e.g., Asia) suggested opportunities to renegotiate shipping contracts.
Revenue Contribution Analysis revealed that North America and Europe were the most profitable regions.
Inventory Efficiency:

Regions with lower inventory turnover rates had higher delays, indicating poor stock management.
Delivery Trends:

Cumulative order analysis showed peak order volumes during specific months, enabling better resource allocation.
Impact
Operational Improvements:

Recommendations to optimize delivery times in underperforming regions.
Implemented targeted strategies to reduce delays for high-risk product categories.
Cost Reduction:

Identified regions and products with high shipping costs, leading to renegotiation of supplier contracts.
Enhanced Decision-Making:

Provided clear, actionable insights into supply chain performance.
Empowered stakeholders to proactively address inefficiencies, resulting in improved customer satisfaction and cost savings.
Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time data for live monitoring of shipments.
Incorporate predictive analytics to forecast delays and inventory shortages.
Expand the dashboard to include environmental impact metrics, such as CO2 emissions per shipment.
